\chapter*{Abstract}

This Bachelor thesis deals with the Riemannian BFGS method, RBFGS method for short, and its implementation in the programming language Julia (\url{https://julialang.org}). The basics about Euclidean quasi-Newton methods and the Euclidean BFGS method with relevant variants thereof are considered. Important basic terms about Riemannian manifolds for line search methods on these are summarized. Quasi-Newton methods on Riemannian manifolds are discussed, it is shown that the curvature condition in a Riemannian quasi-Newton method, which uses the exponential map and the parallel transport, is always satisfied for $\mu$-strongly convex functions. The RBFGS method from \cite{Qi:2011} and from \cite{HuangGallivanAbsil:2015} with the locking condition are considered. The Cautious RBFGS method from \cite{HuangAbsilGallivan:2018} and the limited-memory RBFGS method from \cite{HuangGallivanAbsil:2015} are considered. Core aspects of each method are discussed and convergence characteristics are addressed. An idea for the implementation of the RBFGS method in the programming language Julia is presented. Basic numerical experiments for the Rayleigh quotient minimization on the sphere and for the Brockett cost function minimization on the Stiefel manifold are used to illustrate the performance of the RBFGS method and the cautious limited-memory RBFGS method from the package \lstinline!Manopt.jl! (\url{https://manoptjl.org}).
