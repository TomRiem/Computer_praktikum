\chapter{Introduction}

Optimization on Riemannian manifolds, also called Riemannian optimization, concerns finding an optimum of a real-valued function $f$ defined over a manifold. It can be thought of as unconstrained optimization on a constrained space. In this context, attention also turned to the generalization of quasi-Newton methods to the Riemannian setup. The first research paper to focus this topic was \cite{Gabay:1982}, which deals with the generalization of the well-known BFGS method, which has also received the most attention so far in the Riemannian setup. This work deals with the generalization of the not less unknown Symmetric Rank-One update, or short SR1 update, which does not inherit the positive definiteness. It is shown how the SR1 update is generalized for operators on the tangent space of a manifold and the performance of a Riemannian SR1 quasi-Newton method implemented in the package \lstinline!Manopt.jl! (available at \url{https://manoptjl.org}, \cite{Bergmann:2019}) is compared with that of a Riemannian BFGS method.
